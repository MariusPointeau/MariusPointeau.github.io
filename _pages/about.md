## About Me

Iâ€™m a second-year game programming student at [Isart Digital](https://www.isart.fr/), specializing in **gameplay** and **AI**.  
I work mainly with **C++** and **C#**, using **Unity** and **Unreal Engine** as my primary tools.  

I enjoy tackling technical challenges and exploring innovative approaches to gameplay systems and artificial intelligence. While my portfolio currently showcases my learning journey rather than big highlight projects, I am continuously experimenting, building, and pushing myself to improve.  

My long-term goal is to become a **gameplay programmer**, with a strong focus on **AI-driven systems** that make games feel more dynamic, immersive, and alive.
